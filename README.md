This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is an e-commerce application with modern design and animations, the ability to add and edit products on the go using Sanity, all advanced cart, and checkout functionalities, and most importantly, the complete integration with Stripe so that you can cover real payments.

This project utilizes:
- Advanced React Best Practices such as folder and file structure, hooks, and refs
- Advanced State Management of the entire application using React Context API
- Next.js Best Practices such as file-based routing and data using server-side rendering and static generation
- Integration through Stripe to manage payments, products, shipping rates, and the entire checkout process
