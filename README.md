This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is an e-commerce application with modern design and animations, the ability to add and edit products on the go using Sanity, all advanced cart, and checkout functionalities, and most importantly, the complete integration with Stripe so that you can cover real payments.

This project uses the best practices coupled with JavaScript to make a fully functional web application!
